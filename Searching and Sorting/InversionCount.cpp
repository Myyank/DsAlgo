/*
For a given integer array/list of size N, find the total number of 'Inversions' that may exist.
An inversion is defined for a pair of integers in the array/list when the following two conditions are met.
A pair (arr[i], arr[j]) is said to be an inversion when,
1. arr[i] > arr[j] 
2. i < j

Where 'arr' is the input array/list, 'i' and 'j' denote the indices ranging from [0, N).

Input format :
The first line of input contains an integer N, denoting the size of the array.

The second line of input contains N integers separated by a single space, denoting the elements of the array.
Output format :
The only line of output prints the total count of inversions in the array.
Note:
You are not required to print anything. Return the total number of inversion count.

Constraints :
1 <= N <= 10^5 
1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9

Time Limit: 1sec

Sample Input 1 :
3
3 2 1

Sample Output 1 :
3
Explanation of Sample Input 1:
We have a total of three pairs which satisfy the condition of inversion. (3, 2), (2, 1) and (3, 1).

Sample Input 2 :
5
2 5 1 3 4

Sample Output 2 :
4
